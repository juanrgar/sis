SIS (SPARC Instruction Simulator)
=================================

The purpose of this project is to develop a standalone version of SIS that
could also include improvements, e.g. more GRLIB units implemented, profiling
support, etc.

All important code has been originally written by Jiri Gaisler.  Unfair
attribution is not intended.
